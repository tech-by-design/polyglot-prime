These act states would be associated with an observation status of `preliminary` until they are all completed and then a status of `final` would be applied.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-observation-status.html#observation-status-corrected\">corrected</a></td><td>Corrected</td><td>Subsequent to being Final, the observation has been modified to correct an error in the test result.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem-observation-status.html#observation-status-entered-in-error\">entered-in-error</a></td><td>Entered in Error</td><td>The observation has been withdrawn following previous final release.  This electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that real-world decisions were based on it.
