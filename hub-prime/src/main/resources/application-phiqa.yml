              # The allowed values for mTlsStrategy are as follows:
              # - no-mTls: No mTLS is used. The WebClient sends a standard HTTP POST request to the scoring engine API without mutual TLS (mTLS).
              # - aws-secrets: mTLS is enabled. The WebClient retrieves the TLS key and certificate from AWS Secrets Manager, and then sends an HTTPS POST request to the scoring engine API with mutual TLS authentication.
              # - mTlsResources: mTLS is enabled. The WebClient reads the TLS key and certificate from a local folder, and then sends an HTTPS POST request to the scoring engine API with mutual TLS authentication.
              # - post-stdin-payload-to-nyec-datalake-external: This option runs a bash script via ProcessBuilder. The payload is passed through standard input (STDIN) to the script, which uses `curl` to send the request to the scoring engine API. In the `phiqa` environment, mTLS is enabled for this request. In other environments, mTLS is disabled for this script.
